## Dataset Overview
This data contains the name for 1895 games with 34 of ESRB rating content 
with the name and console as features for each game.

A single data point is represented as a binary value 0-1 for 
Console and a binary vector for the features of ESRB content.

**Note:** (0 = PS4)  (1 = PS4 & Xbox_one)

## ESRB rating description
| ESRB_rating | Description     |

## Final results of ML models

| Algorithms    | Time(s)            | Accuracy(%)        |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Decision Tree | Faster (0.01-0.05) | Lower   (80%-83%)  |
| Random Forest | Slower (0.70-0.80) | Higher (85%-90%)   |

##  final conclusion
 We conclude that ESRB take a lot of types of content in consideration to rate the game properly, and we can see from the charts that each content type has a different effect on the rating for example, most of the games that has strong language content is for matures, so it is a useful idea to build a machine learning module to predict the ratings
